# Metadata: rule ID, description, protocol number, version
  id: CO-101-001

DATA:
# Where all of the following live:
# sources (required tables)
# requires (required columns per table)
  sources:
    - adlb_clovis
    - adsl_clovis
    
  requires:
    adlb_clovis:
      - ANRHI
      - PARAM
      - LBORRES
      - VISIT
    adsl_clovis:
      - METLIV

RULES:
# Flag definitions, severity
# AST is Aspartate Aminotransferase (U/L) 
# If AST at screening is >2.5 but <= 5x ULN, then confirm the presence of tumor lesions in the liver at screening. If not confirmed, flag.
# Note: This is confirmation of eligibility as per Inclusion Criteria #9. If AST is above 2.5 and there are no liver lesions reported at screening, the patient is not eligible to participate in the study.
# Will involve a calculation 5 x ULN (ANRHI variable) or referring to tox grade variable as per CTCAE v4.0 (version specified in protocol).

  alert_code: AST_NO_LIVER_CONFIRM
  severity: "critical"
  message: "Subject has elevated AST at screening but no confirmed liver lesion."
  description: |
    If AST > 2.5*ULN at screening, confirm presence of liver lesion.
    If no liver lesion is reported, flag subject as ineligible per Inclusion Criterion 9.
  logic:
    if AST at screening > 2.5*ANRHI and AST at screening ≤ 5*ANRHI:        
      if liver lesion is not confirmed:
        flag subject as ineligible (IC#9 violation).
# SQL Translation:
# select  subjid,param,paramcd,LBORRES,anrhi,visit from adlb_clovis where paramcd='AST' and lborres::float > 2.5*ANRHI  order by subjid, visit;
# select  subjid, METLIV from adsl_clovis where metliv is null order by subjid;
# Prompt
# Write a single SQL query that implements this DSL rule by joining adlb_clovis and adsl_clovis. Only return subjects where AST at pre-entrollment is > 2.5 × ANRHI and ≤ 5 × ANRHI and METLIV is not 'Y'. Use paramcd = 'AST' and visit = 'Screening' for the lab. Include subject ID, AST result, ANRHI, and METLIV in the output.
# liver lessions not present may mean null values in the data
